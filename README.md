# area-code-bst-path
This program takes command line input of ./areaCode areaCodeList.txt X where
X is a 3 digit area code. The program will go through a binary search tree (the
path that is taken through the tree is printed out) made of all area codes in 
Canada. If it is found, the province the area code is from will be displayed.

I used https://www.areacodehelp.com/canada/canada_area_codes.shtml to help 
create areaCodeList.txt.

This program was made and tested in a Linux environment.
